# Sentiment-Words
List of words to use in positive and negative sentiment analisys. 

Some words are only roots of words - making the code lighter.

For example "harm" can be used to find "harmful" and "harming" - that is why it seems some words may be mispelled.

Includes emoji unicode - often used to express sentiment on social media.
