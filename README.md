# Sentiment-Words
List of words to use in positive and negative sentiment analisys. 

Some words are only roots of words - making the code lighter.

For example "horrif" can be used to find "horrific" and "horrifying" - that is why it seems some words may be mispelled.

Includes emoji unicode - often used to express sentiment on social media.
